                o lived on the Mount St. Helens 
                volcano. The owner and caretaker 
                of Mount St. Helens Lodge at 
                Spirit Lake, at the foot of the 
                mountain, he came to brief fame 
                as a folk hero in the months 
                preceding the 
                <strong>volcano's</strong> 
                1980 
                eruption after he stubbornly 
                refused to leave his home despite 
                evacuation orders. He appeared on the front page of The New York Times and The San Francisco Examiner and garnered the attention of National Geographic, United Press International, and The Today Show. Truman is presumed to have been killed by a pyroclastic flow that overtook his lodge and buried the site under 150 feet (50 m)
