# Assignment Overview: Lab 2

- Your assignment will be to create an "About Me" HTML and JS project.

- Note that as we progress through the week, new user stories will be added to the "About Me" project to guide the development of new features.

### User Stories for "About Me" (MVP)

("MVP" = "Minimum Viable Product" which is the most basic successful functionality of our project. Extensions, added features, and other enhancements fall under the category of "Stretch Goals.")

This is our first exposure to user stories. This is a device commonly used in software development to identify what the functionality and design of a product should be by considering the interests and motivations of people with varied multiple points of view.

User stories typically take the form of, "As X, I want Y, so that Z" but do not necessarily need that structure.

- As a portfolio visitor, I would like to quickly learn a few things about the student, such as: a short bio, education, an overview of job experience, and goals.
- As a portfolio visitor, I want to be convinced that a student is worthy of employment.
- As a technical portfolio visitor, I want to View Source of an About Me page to assess skills with HTML.
- As a fun-loving portfolio visitor, I want to be given a guessing game that shows how fun-loving and interesting the student is, maybe including things about the student that would not ordinarily appear in a portfolio page.
- As a portfolio visitor, I want to be asked my name, so that the program is personalized to my experience.
- As a portfolio visitor, I want to be asked five questions, so that I can guess the answers and get to know the developer.
- As a portfolio visitor, I want to be notified after each question, so I am aware whether my answer was correct or not.

Not **user** stories, but good things to keep in mind:

- As a developer, I want to use markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I prefer, with effective use of the markup possibilities offered by HTML.
- As a developer, I want to carefully design my scripts, so I can understand how to organize and write my code to achieve my goals in interactivity.
- As a developer, I want to create a simple script for my index.html page using JavaScript, so that I can use the browser to send a response to the user.
- As a developer, I want to be able to debug my code by using well structured console messages.
- As a developer, I want to manage my code through an online version control system, so I have the ability to work with others, manage my revisions, and keep a thorough record of my progress.

### Technical Requirements for "About Me"

- Follow the instructions in the adjacent ["Setting Up a New Code 201 Project"](./setting-up-a-new-project.md) document
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed.
- Your JS file contains a 'use strict' declaration at the top. Always.
- Design a guessing game about you that involves **FIVE** yes/no questions. Be creative and fun and whimsical. Or not. It's up to you! It's your project!
- The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either `.toUpperCase()` or `.toLowerCase()` used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.
- Useful and descriptive `console.log()` messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.
- Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have
- Add, Commit, Push process is being followed; it is evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.


### Supporting Information

#### Git

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

##### Git command basics:

- `git status`
   - Provides a detailed description of current state in working directory

- `git add <file/s>`
   - Include file/s in staged/tracked status of working directory; you can use `.` as a wildcard to capture all files

- `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
   - Snapshot the tracked changes in current working directory, with a brief message describing the changes

- `git push <destination> <branch>`
   - Push local commits to GitHub

### Add, Commit, Push (ACP): Learn it. Know it. Live it.
