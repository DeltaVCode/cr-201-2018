# Assignment Overview: Lab 3

For this lab we will be adding a few things to the work we've done so far. Use the User Stories and the Technical Requirements to make a plan for how to proceed. Assume that all user stories from the previous lab carry over, except for the ones that are modified or are superseded here.

It can be very handy to take notes and sketch things out when you are planning your projects and the code within it.

## User Stories (MVP... what you must do as a minimum)

- As a portfolio visitor, I would like to quickly learn a few things about the student, such as: a short bio, education, an overview of job experience, and goals.
- As a portfolio visitor, I want to read some appropriate biographical elements as unordered lists, such as education summary and/or work experience.
- As a portfolio visitor, I want to read a Top Ten list (ordered list in HTML) of something personable, e.g. Top Ten Favorite Movies or Top Ten Places I Want to Visit.
- As a porfolio visitor, I want to see creative and tasteful style and layout that demonstrates CSS skills.
- As a portfolio vistor, I want to answer a sixth question that is a numeric guessing game (for instance, "What is my favorite number?" or "How many Pok√©mon did I catch this week?").
- As a numeric guessing game participant, I want to be told whether a guess is 'too high' or 'too low', with up to four opportunities to get the correct answer.
- As a portfolio visitor, I want to answer a seventh question that has multiple possible correct answers. For instance, "Can you guess a state that I have lived in besides Washington?".
- As a multiple-choice guessing game participant, I want up to six tries to guess a single correct answer, after which I will be told all of the possible correct answers whether or not I guessed one correctly.
- As a technical portfolio visitor, I want to View Source and see that the correct answers to the seventh question are stored in an array.
- As a portfolio visitor, I want to be told how many correct answers I got at the end of the game, with a personalized message (e.g. "You got 4 out of 7 questions correct, Bobbi! Better luck next time.").

### Stretch Goals

- As a prolific numeric guessing game participant, I want to guess a new random number each time I visit the page, so that I can't memorize the correct answer.

## Developer Stories

- As a developer, I want to use markup to structure my index.html page, so the layout is in the order of assembly I prefer, with effective use of the markup possibilities offered by HTML.
- As a developer, I want to carefully design my scripts, so I can understand how to organize and write my code to achieve my goals in interactivity.
- As a developer, I want to create a simple script for my index.html page using JavaScript, so that I can use the browser to send a response to the user.
- As a developer, I want to use thoughtful and descriptive console.log() throughout my code to help test my work and assist with debugging.
- As a developer, I want to manage my code through an online version control system, so I have the ability to work with others, manage my revisions, and keep a thorough record of my progress.

### Developer Stretch Goals

- As a developer, I want to make my code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions in my guessing game into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array), and modifying the game logic such that a `for` loop will control the flow from question to question.
- Move the guessing game to a separate HTML file, list the questions on the page, and then have the answers fill in on the page after the user provides the answers.

### Technical Requirements

- **Do not write any functions in your JavaScript.**
- Per the user stories, you will need to include in your HTML at least one each of an ordered and an unordered list.
- Use `prompt` for input and `alert` for output to the user, unless you are working on the Stretch Goal.
- Expect that you will probably need both `for` and `while` structures for your sixth and seventh questions. But not necessarily.

### Submitting Your Assignment

- Submit the link to your GitHub repo for this project.
- Add a comment to this Canvas submission with answers to the following questions.
  - How did this go, overall?
  - What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?
